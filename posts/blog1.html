          The first time I had Sukiyaki, I was studying in Kanazawa, Japan.
          I remember it was in winter, our seminar professor took us to a very popular sukiyaki resturant in local.
          I was so exctied and suprised by the amazing taste.<br>
          After that, I was wondering if I could do this at home,well it turned out not that difficult to make it on our own.
